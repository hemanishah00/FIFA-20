Analyzed the players' datasets from 2015-2020 to predict the team ranks in 2021. 
Pre-processed the datasets by examining the collinearity and correlations between the variables to reduce the number of predictors from 104 to 46. 
Implemented a 4-layered Neural Network to predict the ranks of players in 2019. 
Deployed 4 different Logistic Regression models on the 2019 data and compiled their results to predict the players' positions in 2020. 
Predicted if a defender could become a forward player based on the attacking abilities. 
Compared the team performances and ranked the support staff based on the team performance from 2015 to 2020 using Linear Regression.
